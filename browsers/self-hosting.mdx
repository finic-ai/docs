description: "How run and deploy Finic's Chrome image"
---

Start by cloning [the Finic repo](https://github.com/finic-ai/finic).
```bash
git clone https://github.com/finic-ai/finic.git
```

## Running Locally
Run the image locally the same as any other Docker container.

```bash
docker compose
docker up
```

Once the container is running, you can connect to it like this:

<CodeGroup>
```python Playwright (Python)
from playwright.sync_api import sync_playwright

playwright = sync_playwright().start()
browser = playwright.chromium.conne t(cdp="ws://localhost:8080/ws")    
page = browser.new_page()
await page.goto("https://github.com/finic-ai/finic")
# ... The rest of your automation code
```
```typescript Puppeteer (NodeJS)
import puppeteer from 'puppeteer-core';

(async () => {
  const browser = await puppeteer.connect({
    browserWSEndpoint: 'ws://localhost:8080/ws'
  });
  const page = await browser.newPage();
  await page.goto('https://github.com/finic-ai/finic');
  // ... The rest of your automation code
})();

```
</CodeGroup>

## Deploying
Deploying the Finic chrome image should be the same as deploying any other container to your cloud platform. Links for each major platform:

<Note>**This is a preview.** Finic Cloud is currently in development - check out [how to self-host](browsers/self-hosting) in the meantime.</Note>
Connecting to Finic's Browser servce is easy.

When developing, your code probably looks something like this:
<CodeGroup>
```python Playwright (Python)
from playwright.sync_api import sync_playwright

playwright = sync_playwright().start()
browser = await playwright.chromium.launch(headless=False)

page = await browser.new_page()
page.goto("https://github.com/finic-ai/finic")
```
```typescript Puppeteer (NodeJS)
import puppeteer from 'puppeteer-core';

(async () => {
  const browser = await puppeteer.launch({ headless: false });
  const page = await browser.newPage();
  await page.goto('https://github.com/finic-ai/finic');
})();

```
</CodeGroup>

All you have to do is replace this line:
<CodeGroup>
```python Playwright (Python)
browser = await playwright.chromium.launch(headless=False)
```
```typescript Puppeteer (NodeJS)
const browser = await puppeteer.launch({ headless: false });
```
</CodeGroup>

with this line:
<CodeGroup>
```python Playwright (Python)
browser = playwright.chromium.connect_over_cdp("ws://browser.finic.io/?apikey=<your-finic-api-key>")
```
```typescript Puppeteer (NodeJS)
const browser = await puppeteer.connect({ browserWSEndpoint: 'ws://browser.finic.io/?apikey=<your-finic-api-key>' });
```
</CodeGroup>

That's it. If it works locally, your code should still work once you deploy, as long as you container supports WebSocket connections.

title: 'Quickstart [5 min]'
description: 'Connect to a cloud browser and use it to fill out a form online'
---
<Note>**This is a preview.** Finic Cloud is currently in development - check out [how to self-host](browsers/self-hosting) in the meantime.</Note>

## 1. Clone repo
```bash
git clone 
```
## 2. Launch the Chrome container
```bash
sudo docker-compose up --build
```
## 3. Run the test script to connect to the browser. It will navigate to [this automation testing page](https://testpages.herokuapp.com/styled/basic-html-form-test.html) and
fill out the form with hard-coded data.
```bash
python testscript.py
```

## Next Steps
You can now modify the test script however you want, or add Finic to any other web automation project by changing a single line of code.

<CodeGroup>
```python Playwright (Python)
from playwright.sync_api import sync_playwright

playwright = sync_playwright().start()
browser = playwright.chromium.connect_over_cdp(cdp="ws://browser.finic.io/?apikey=<your-finic-api-key>")    
page = browser.new_page()
await page.goto("https://github.com/finic-ai/finic")
```
```typescript Puppeteer (NodeJS)
import puppeteer from 'puppeteer-core';

(async () => {
  const browser = await puppeteer.connect({
    browserWSEndpoint: 'ws://browser.finic.io/?apikey=<your-finic-api-key>'
  });
  const page = await browser.newPage();
  await page.goto('https://github.com/finic-ai/finic');
})();

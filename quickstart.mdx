## Create a new project
Start by installing Finic.
```shell
pip install finicapi
```

This installs `create-finic-app` which creates a new python project with boilerplate for poetry, pydantic, and Finic. 
This example project uses Playwright to sign into [this website](https://practicetestautomation.com/practice-test-login/) and take a screenshot.
```

## Edit and test locally

Running the project locally works the same as any other poetry project.
```shell
poetry instally
poetry run start
```

In order for the example automation to work, you'll need to authenticate with credentials stored in a secret manager, deploy the agent, 
and pass in a `user_id` to retrieve credentials at runtime.
<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion icon="lock" title="Save Credentials Locally">
    Rename `secrets.json.example` to `secrets.json` and replace the contents with the following:
    ```json
    {
      "id_123": {
        "username": "student"
        "password": "Password123"
      }
    }
    ```
    `secrets.json` is just a convenient way to test agents locally. In production, you'll want to fetch secrets from Finic Secret Manager.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion icon="brackets-curly" title="Pass In Runtime Arguments">
    Rename `input.json.example` to `input.json` and replace the contents with the following:
    ```json
    {
      "user_id": "id_123"
    }
    ```
    This passes an argument called `user_id` with a value of `id_123` to your agent when it's triggered.
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

## Deploy and run your agent
Run the following in your project directory:
```shell
finic-deploy
```
The example agent is now deployed to Finic Cloud. You can sign in to the [Finic dashboard](https://app.finic.ai) to view it.
Once deployed, the agent no longer uses `secrets.json` and `inputs.json`. Instead, secrets must be set in the Finic Secret Manager and
inputs are specified when you trigger the agent.

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion icon="lock" title="Add Credentials to the Secret Manager">
    Go to https://app.finic.ai/ and sign in. Navigate to the [Secrets](https://app.finic.ai/secrets) tab. Click "Add Secret" to add the credentials we used previously.
    ```json
    "service_name": "Practice Test",
    "secret_type": "Password",
    "account_id": "id_123",
    "secret": {
      "username": "student",
      "password": "Password123"
    }
    ```
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion icon="play" title="Run the Agent">
    Navigate to the [Agents](https://app.finic.ai/agents) tab. You should see the agent you just deployed in the list on the Agents tab. Click "Run" on it and paste the contents of your `input.json` file.
    ```json
    {
      "user_id": "id_123"
    }
    ```
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion icon="eye" title="View Results">
    Once your agent has started running, you can view its progress in the [Monitoring](https://app.finic.ai/monitoring) tab. Once it finishes running, you'll also find the logs here.

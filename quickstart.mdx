### 1. Clone repo
```bash
git clone https://github.com/finic-ai/finic.git
```
### 2. Run the test script locally to make sure it works. 
It will open a local browser and navigate to [this automation testing page](https://testpages.herokuapp.com/styled/basic-html-form-test.html),
then fill out the form with hard-coded data.
```bash
python testscript.py
```

### 3. Launch the Chrome container
```bash
sudo docker-compose up --build
```
### 4. Connect the test script to the container 
Comment out this line:
```python testscript.py
browser = p.chromium.launch(headless=False, slow_mo=500)
```
and uncomment this line:
```python testscript.py
browser = p.chromium.connect_over_cdp("ws://localhost:8000/ws")
```

Then running the script again:
```bash
python testscript.py
```

This is how you can toggle between local testing with a headful browser, to connecting your script to a deployed Chrome container in production.
In reality you'll probably want to deploy the Docker container to your cloud platform instead of running it on localhost.

## Next Steps
You can now modify the test script however you want, or add Finic to an existing web automation project by using `playwright.connect_over_cdp()` or `puppeteer.connect()`

<CodeGroup>
```python Playwright (Python)
from playwright.sync_api import sync_playwright

playwright = sync_playwright().start()
browser = playwright.chromium.connect_over_cdp("ws://browser.finic.io/?apikey=<your-finic-api-key>")    
page = browser.new_page()
await page.goto("https://github.com/finic-ai/finic")
```
```typescript Puppeteer (NodeJS)
import puppeteer from 'puppeteer-core';

(async () => {
  const browser = await puppeteer.connect({
    browserWSEndpoint: 'ws://browser.finic.io/?apikey=<your-finic-api-key>'
  });
  const page = await browser.newPage();
  await page.goto('https://github.com/finic-ai/finic');
})();

```

description: "How to view logs and recordings from your automations."
---

You can view logs and recordings of each time your automation has run, directly from the [Finic dashboard](https://app.finic.io). Click on any automation, then
select any execution to view its metadata.

### Status
Shows you if this execution succeeded, failed, or is still running.

### Results
Any results returned by the automation, in JSON format.

### Logs
Logs from the instance that ran this automation. Any print statements or other logging tools will all dump into these logs.

### Session Recording
A video recording of the session, assuming the automation was not running in headless mode. Useful for debuggin issues and seeing where the automation failed.

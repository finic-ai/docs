---

Deploying a Finic automation is easy. Simply run `finic deploy` from your command line in any project that's a valid Finic project. All you need is a Finic API key, which you can
find [here](https://app.finic.io/settings).

Once an automation is deployed, you can find it at https://app.finic.io/automations.

## Running an automation
### Dashboard
You can run automations manually from the dashboard by clicking on any automation to open it, then clicking the "Run" button.

### API
You can invoke automations programatically by sending a request to the `run-agent` endpoint. See the [API reference](/api-reference/endpoint/run-agent) for more information.

## Options
You can provide the following options both in the dashboard and via API:
- **max_retries:** The number of times to retry this automation if it fails. Helps account for non-deterministic issues that cause flakiness, like network issues or temporary downtime.
- **browser_id:** A unique identifer for the browser you'd like to use. Useful for preserving cookies and local storage accross sessions to avoid having to authenticate each time.

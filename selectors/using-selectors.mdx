<Note>**This is a preview:** The Finic Selector Service is currently in development and not yet available.</Note>

Once you've [registered selectors](/selectors/generating#loading-selectors-into-finic-selector-service-fss) you can start using them in your application.

```python
from finic import FinicSelectorService, SelectorError

page = browser.new_page()
fss = FinicSelectorService(api_key=<your-finic-api-key>, page=page)

# Fetch selectors
button = page.query_selector(fss.get("fork-button"))
```

## Self-healing selectors
If you'd like to enable self-healing mode, simply pass `regenerate=True` to the `get()` method.

```python
button = page.query_selector(fss.get("fork-button", regenerate=True))
```

This attempts to locate the element from the current page based on the selector retrieved. If it fails, it makes a call to a LLM to
generate a new selector, passing in data cached from previous successful executions.

There are two ways to run deployed agents: through the Finic dashboard or through an API request.

## Finic dashboard
You can run agents manually from https://app.finic.ai/agents.

## API request
You can trigger your agents programatically with an API call.
`<Finic-API-Key>` can be found in the Settings page of the dashboard. The `<Agent-ID>` is the unique identifier for your agent you
set when you deployed it.

`arguments` accepts a JSON object and provides each key/value pair as an argument to the function wrapped by the `finic.workflow_entrypoint` [decorator](/development#the-finic-decorator).
```curl
curl --location --request POST 'https://api.finic.ai/run-agent' \
--header 'Authorization: Bearer <Finic-API-Key>' \
--header 'Content-Type: application/json' \
--data '{
    "agent_id": <Agent-ID>,
    "input": {
        "arg1": "example,
        "arg2": "example"
    }
}'
```

**Coming soon:** Trigger your agents with the Finic SDK.
